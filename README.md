# concurrent-directory-tree
This is a project in C for concurrent programming course. It is an implementation of concurrent directory tree.<br>
It enables the user to perform simple operations like creating a new directory tree or a new directory, removing or moving it etc.<br>

For this project I have used a little enhanced version of the reader/writer idea.

To compile and run main.c use these commmands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
